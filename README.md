# Marine Debris Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a neural network model to classify images of marine debris based on their danger level. The approach involves using a YOLOv10 network for object detection to identify marine debris in images, followed by using a ResNet50 model to classify the danger level of the detected debris.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marine-debris-classification.git
cd marine-debris-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements
Python 3.x

PyTorch

torchvision

OpenCV

Other required libraries listed in requirements.txt

## Model Architecture
YOLOv10: This model is utilized for detecting marine debris in images. It outputs bounding boxes and class labels for the identified debris.

ResNet50: After detecting the debris, the images (with bounding boxes) are fed into a ResNet50 model to classify the danger level of the debris on a scale from 1 to 3.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images containing various types of marine debris, annotated with bounding boxes and classes. The dataset is split into training and validation sets, with annotations provided in a compatible format for the YOLO model. 

## Dataset Sources
Some images taken and generated by ourselves
Others from this open source dataset https://universe.roboflow.com/reconhecimentoimgs/global-solution/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true
